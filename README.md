Data Analysis Projects:

1. [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/rebornwalker/Data_Analysis_Projects_freeCodeCamp/blob/main/mean_var_std.py): Developed a Python calculator for mean, variance, and standard deviation using NumPy.

2. [Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/rebornwalker/Data_Analysis_Projects_freeCodeCamp/blob/main/demographic_data_analyzer.py): Utilized pandas to process 32,000 records, uncovering key insights like the average age of men (39.4) and the top country with the highest percentage of wealthy individuals (United States, 22%). Demonstrated strong data analysis and statistical skills by identifying trends in education and income levels.

3. [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/rebornwalker/Data_Analysis_Projects_freeCodeCamp/blob/main/medical_data_visualizer.py): Analyzed health metrics from a dataset of 70,000 records to create insightful visualizations, including categorical plots and heatmaps that reveal correlations among various health indicators.

4. [Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/rebornwalker/Data_Analysis_Projects_freeCodeCamp/blob/main/time_series_visualizer.py): Analyzed 87 million page views, generating line, bar, and box plots to reveal web traffic trends from May 2016 to December 2019.

5. [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/rebornwalker/Data_Analysis_Projects_freeCodeCamp/blob/main/sea_level_predictor.py): Created a sea level predictor in Python using linear regression to analyze and visualize historical sea level trends.
